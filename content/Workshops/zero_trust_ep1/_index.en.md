### AWS Zero Trust Workshop Episode 1

This workshop focuses on applying Zero Trust principles to the service-to-service architectures we see in many micro-architecture or distributed environments today. This is not the only type of architecture that can benefit from these principles however, as scenarios like end-user access and Industrial IoT can benefit as well. Keep an eye out for any sequels that may delve into these use cases as we continue the Zero Trust saga.
