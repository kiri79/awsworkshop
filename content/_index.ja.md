## Welcome

# Welcome to the **AWS Cloud Security Virtual Event**. Virtual attendees can expect two days of security, identity, and compliance learning and community # building. Thank you for joining us to dive deep into how AWS can keep your businesses and customers secure in the cloud. Over the next two days you will have access to workshops, sessions, and events to help you gain an understanding of the AWS service ecosystem and introduce you to a variety of best practices that can be applied to securing your environments and workloads running in AWS.

# Security and Compliance is a [shared responsibility](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) between AWS and the customer. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure which runs all of the services offered and this responsibility is known as the **Security of the Cloud**. AWS customers benefit from a data center and network architecture built to satisfy the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. Customers responsibility, known as the **Security in the Cloud**, is determined by which services the customer chooses to use.

# The workshops and other hands-on content we will discuss are focused on the **Security in the Cloud** and they will guide you through prepared scenarios that represent common use cases and operational tasks you'll face in building securely on AWS. They will also highlight the design principals from the [AWS Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Security-Pillar.pdf), which can help you improve your security posture. Additional frameworks that will be discussed include the [NIST Cyber Security Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/components-framework) and the [AWS Cloud Adoption Framework Security Perspective](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS_CAF_Security_Perspective.pdf). Having an understanding of these frameworks will help you in adopting the practices discussed in this AWS Cloud Security Virtual Event within your organizations.
