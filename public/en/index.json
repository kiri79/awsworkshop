	"content": "Welcome Thank you for joining us from November 11 to 12 at AWS Security Roadshow Japan 2021. Virtual attendees can expect two days of security, identity, and compliance learning and community building. Thank you for joining us to dive deep into how AWS can keep your businesses and customers secure in the cloud. Over the next two days you will have access to workshops, sessions, and events to help you gain an understanding of the AWS service ecosystem and introduce you to a variety of best practices that can be applied to securing your environments and workloads running in AWS.\nSecurity and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure which runs all of the services offered and this responsibility is known as the Security of the Cloud. AWS customers benefit from a data center and network architecture built to satisfy the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. Customers responsibility, known as the Security in the Cloud, is determined by which services the customer chooses to use.\nThe workshops and other hands-on content we will discuss are focused on the Security in the Cloud and they will guide you through prepared scenarios that represent common use cases and operational tasks you\u0026rsquo;ll face in building securely on AWS. They will also highlight the design principals from the AWS Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar, which can help you improve your security posture. Additional frameworks that will be discussed include the NIST Cyber Security Framework and the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework Security Perspective. Having an understanding of these frameworks will help you in adopting the practices discussed in this AWS Security Roadshow Japan 2021 within your organizations.\nAgenda  On-Demand Tracks Workshops  "

In this session, we will talk about the hardware specifications of EC2 Nitro instances and the guarantees we provide to our customers with respect to data protection and data sovereignty. By participating in this session, you will gain a better understanding of how to keep sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) safe on the AWS cloud. 100   DevSecOps at PayPay achieving secure and fast development  This session discusses the challenges of managing security compliance for multiple AWS accounts and discusses how the DevSecOps team explores Infrastructure as Code, AWS Learn how to enforce security compliance using Security Hub and Automation. 200    Workshops These workshops are designed to help you get familiar with AWS Security and Operational services so you can improve your security and compliance objectives.    Topic Description Skill Level Time     AWS Zero Trust Workshop Episode 1 This workshop focuses on applying Zero Trust principles to the service-to-service architectures we see in many micro-architecture or distributed environments today. This is not the only type of architecture that can benefit from these principles however, as scenarios like end-user access and Industrial IoT can benefit as well. Keep an eye out for any sequels that may delve into these use cases as we continue the Zero Trust saga. Intermediate 2 hours    "

Cloud-native companies are bringing more customer-facing services to market faster, with shorter refresh intervals than ever before. This creates complex scenarios that make compliance difficult, and the costs of managing this compliance matrix often cannot be addressed by traditional approaches. In this session, you will learn about the latest AWS compliance programs and services in the APJ market, and compliance to keep up with the speed of digital transformation Here\u0026rsquo;s how we\u0026rsquo;re evolving our program. 100   DevSecOps at PayPay achieving secure and fast development  This session discusses the challenges of managing security compliance for multiple AWS accounts and discusses how the DevSecOps team explores Infrastructure as Code, AWS Learn how to enforce security compliance using Security Hub and Automation. 200    "
